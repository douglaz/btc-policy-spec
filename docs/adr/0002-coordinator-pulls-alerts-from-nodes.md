# Alerts are pulled by the coordinator, not pushed by nodes

> **Context under [ADR-0012](0012-model-b-spend-and-duress-architecture.md):** this still holds for v0 (coordinator trusted pre-wrench delivers alerts honestly; during a wrench you already know). Under the untrusted-post-wrench coordinator, alert delivery is single-point-suppressible only in a narrow simultaneous quorum+coordinator compromise; per-node alert push is a *possible* v1 hardening, not committed.


Nodes make no outbound connections. [Under Model B (ADR-0012), nodes make outbound peer + broadcast connections; "no outbound" applied to the pre-Model-B design.] Each vault node queues its alerts (watchtower hits, refusals) and its log locally and exposes them on a pull endpoint; the coordinator polls all nodes and surfaces alerts to the user. The coordinator is trusted for this, as it is for spend orchestration in the MVP.

## Considered Options

- **Per-node user-owned push sink (webhook per node)** — rejected for the MVP: five alert channels to configure, and it breaks the "nodes only answer requests / only watch the blockchain" shape.

## Consequences

- Accepted risk, stated openly: a compromised coordinator can suppress alerts, and alert latency is bounded by coordinator uptime/polling. This extends the eng-review D11 posture (coordinator-side alerting) to watchtower alerts.
- Watchtower *detection* remains n-way independent (each node watches its own chain view); only *delivery* is centralized. Per-node push sinks remain a possible post-MVP hardening without changing detection.
- Nodes need a bounded, persistent-enough alert queue and a cursor-based pull API (e.g., `GET /events?since=`).
