# Rollout funding caps, and a test-only waiver of ADR-0009

**AMENDED by [ADR-0017](0017-one-external-review-at-stage-9.md):** the caps below now carry a
SECOND load they were not designed for. External review #1 was removed from stage 1, so the dust
cap is also the primary mitigation for the absence of any external human review before stage 9 --
not only for the correlation waiver this ADR introduced it for. Read the two together.

ADR-0009 forbids any correlation class from reaching quorum. The rollout ladder
(`13-operations-and-rollout.md`) nevertheless runs stages 2 through 5 with all five nodes at a **single
hosting provider** — a correlation class holding quorum — and stages 3 and 5 put **real mainnet
funds** behind that topology.

That is a knowing violation, and this ADR is what makes it knowing rather than accidental. Two
independent reviews flagged it; the decision after seeing them was to keep the ladder's ordering
and bound the exposure instead of reordering.

## Decision

**1. Stages 2–5 operate under an explicit, time-limited, test-only waiver of ADR-0009.** A
federation provisioned under this waiver is a *laboratory*, never a custody deployment, whatever
network it runs on.

**2. Every mainnet rung is capped, and the cap must be a NUMBER WITH AN OBSERVER before any mainnet
rung is funded.** "An amount whose total loss is operationally irrelevant" is an intention, not a
control — an operator negotiates that with themselves at funding time. So:

- `btc-policy-cod` sets the per-stage figure and **blocks `4wx`**: stage 3 cannot be funded before a
  cap exists in writing.
- The cap is a **loss budget, not a security invariant** — Bitcoin cannot refuse an incoming deposit,
  and this plan itself deposits into a locked vault after Lockdown. So it must be *observed*, and the
  observer must sit **outside both the provider and the coordinator trust domains**. A watchtower
  alert from the five waived nodes is NOT sufficient: during stages 2–5 one provider reaches all five
  consoles, so an attacker who owns that provider owns every observer, and with the software user key
  they already hold a complete authorization path — they can suppress the alert they would trigger.
  An independent watcher (a separate machine, separate account, watching the descriptor) is the only
  observation that survives the threat the cap is protecting against.
- The figure must be an **aggregate across every live stage vault**, not a per-vault field. Both
  vaults of a stage, plus every earlier Survivor left funded, sum into one exposure.
- **Stage deposit addresses are retired with the stage.** They outlive it otherwise, and a stale
  address is a permissionless path to re-fund a vault whose waiver has expired.
- Breach handling is **mandatory and immediate**: abort or descend the stage and retire the vault.
  A ceiling with no defined response is a metric.
- `imb`'s test-mode bypass must be **compiled out** of stage-6+ and alpha binaries, shipped as a
  separately built, visibly tainted artifact. A runtime "which stage am I" check is operator-controlled
  and therefore no control at all; the same goes for any evidence produced under the waiver, which must
  be machine-readably tainted as non-promotable.
- Reaching a mainnet rung is **not** authorisation to move meaningful savings. Value-at-risk is a
  separate axis, and it moves last.

**2a. The cap fights the purpose of the rungs it protects, and the answer is pre-committed here.**
Stages 3 and 5 exist for earlier exposure to real fee and relay behaviour. At true dust, fees dominate
the outputs and the RBF escape ladder, ancestor pressure and relay evidence are all unrepresentative
— so the honest experimenter's conclusion at stage 3 will be "we need slightly more to get real
data." That pressure is built into the rung's own justification. **The pre-committed answer: accept
unrepresentative fee data at stages 3 and 5.** Representative fee behaviour is acquired at stage 8's
soak, under provider diversity and sealing, where the topology no longer violates ADR-0009. Anyone
proposing to raise a waived stage's cap for better fee data is proposing to void this ADR (below),
not to tune it.

**2b. The waiver expires the TOPOLOGY, and also the SECRETS. Nothing provisioned under the waiver
crosses stage 6.** A stage-2–5 federation lives entirely inside one provider's console reach, so
every secret it touched must be treated as exposed to that provider: operator preimages, node keys,
escape-wallet keys, recovery keys, the coordinator auth key, and the coordinator host itself. Reusing
any of them in a post-waiver federation leaks the waiver forward past its own expiry and silently
un-does it. Fresh key material at stage 6, no exceptions; mechanics in `cod`.

**3. `imb`'s deploy-time correlation enforcement gains an explicit test-mode bypass**, and using
it must be recorded in the stage's artifacts. Without this, `imb` (which promises to *refuse* a
co-located federation) and `4wx` (which *requires* one provider) could not both pass honestly —
the contradiction that prompted this ADR.

**4. The waiver expires at provider diversity.** From stage 6 onward the bypass is unavailable,
and any federation that would need it fails to deploy. The waiver cannot reach an alpha.

## Why sealing does not substitute for diversity

ADR-0005 concedes it directly: *"A VPS is never fully sealed against its provider: web console
and rescue mode remain."* Sealing removes the operator's access, not the provider's. Five sealed
nodes at one provider are therefore still one entity away from quorum, so stages 4 and 5 need
this waiver exactly as much as 2 and 3 do. Any reading in which sealing "fixes" the topology is
wrong.

## What the waiver does NOT cover

By the time stage 3 (first mainnet funds) is reached, these are required — wired as hard
dependencies of `btc-policy-4wx`, not left to discipline:

- **Coordinator host hardening** (`4y3`). The one accepted conditional-theft residual.
- **The fire-path mempool scaling fix** (`zzv`), because mainnet is where congestion is real.

**Hardware signing (`bq6`) is deliberately NOT required for the capped mainnet rungs.** Decided
2026-07-29. Without it the user key is software on the coordinator host, which merges adversary A3
with residual R8b — an attacker who owns that host skips the wrench entirely and signs. That is a
real capability, and the reason it is acceptable here is precisely the dust cap: **the cap is the
mitigation.** What such an attacker gets at stages 3–8 is dust.

The consequence is that **`bq6` becomes mandatory before the caps are lifted**, and it gates the
stage-9 freeze (`yt7`) — the last point before an alpha, and the artifact the external review
examines. An auditor handed a "deployed system" whose user key is a file on the coordinator will
say so immediately, and they will be right.

So the residual risk this ADR knowingly accepts at stages 3 and 5 is narrower than "one provider,
nothing else done": it is **provider-level quorum correlation, a software user key on the
coordinator, unsealed node hosts at stage 3, and an unresolved node lifecycle** — every one of them
bounded by the dust cap, and none of them permitted past stage 9.

## Consequences

- A provider-account compromise (or a provider acting adversarially, or under legal compulsion)
  during stages 2–5 yields all five node keys. Since hardware signing is deferred past these rungs,
  the user key is a file on the coordinator host — so an attacker who takes both gets a complete
  authorization path and none of the off-chain policy (PIN, allowlist, Hold, duress, release gate)
  applies. **The cap is the entire mitigation, and it is the only one.** That is the trade this ADR
  exists to record.
- Provider-account hygiene (strong 2FA, no provider session on the coordinator host) is part of
  the security perimeter for these stages, as ADR-0005 already states.
- Stages 2–5 produce **no evidence about correlation-class independence.** Any claim of ADR-0009
  compliance dates from stage 6, not earlier, and the stage-9 review must be told so.
- If the dust cap is ever raised on a waived stage, this ADR is void and the ladder must be
  reordered to reach provider diversity first.

## Alternatives rejected

- **Reorder the ladder** (both reviewers' recommendation: multi-provider before sealing and before
  any mainnet). Rejected to keep the ladder's experiment-per-rung structure; the caps and this
  waiver are the compensating controls.
- **Drop stages 3 and 5 to signet.** Rejected for the same reason — earlier exposure to real fee
  and relay behaviour was judged worth the capped risk.
- **Silence.** Rejected outright: `imb` and `4wx` would have contradicted each other in the bead
  graph, and the first person to implement `imb`'s enforcement would have blocked the ladder
  without knowing why.
