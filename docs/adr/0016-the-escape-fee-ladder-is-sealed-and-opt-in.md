# The escape fee ladder is sealed, opt-in, and one number

Every `SpendRequest` carries a mandatory Escape. (A `RefreshRequest` does not — it is a Normal-path
self-spend with one PSBT and no Escape, so everything below is scoped to SpendRequest.) The Escape
fee ladder adds up to `MAX_ESCAPE_BUMPS = 3` pre-signed higher-fee alternatives to that Escape, and
because the fee lives inside the signed bytes under SIGHASH_ALL, **each rung is a separate
transaction the Operator must authorize**. A fully-laddered spend therefore presents up to FIVE
transactions for approval where the protocol needs two — up to, not exactly: the ceiling, the dust
floor and the relay increment each drop rungs, so 3 or 4 is common and 2 is the default. (Counted as
TRANSACTIONS PRESENTED, not signatures: a multi-input PSBT takes one signature per input, so a
signature count is not a stable observable.)

The rungs are *derived*, not authored: `escape_fee_ladder` composes them from the Escape at 4×, 16×
and 64× the base fee. So the Operator is not authorizing five transactions in any meaningful sense
— they are authorizing one policy, *"sweep everything to my escape wallet, and pre-approve paying up
to N% of it to get that confirmed"*, which is then encoded as five objects for a machine.

That framing decides where the choice belongs. Under duress is the worst possible moment to reason
about fee multipliers, and the Ceremony is the only moment the Operator is calm, unhurried, and
already making permanent decisions.

## Decision

**1. By default the Operator approves exactly two transactions per `SpendRequest`** — the spend and
the Escape. (A `RefreshRequest` presents one; it has no Escape and no ladder.) A vault
with no ladder is a supported, first-class configuration. Its base obeys `CHN-15`'s
"every input's `nSequence` to `0xfffffffd`", and ingress still validates that base: `SPN-27`
requires the check "even when the ladder is empty".

**2. The ladder is one sealed number: `escape_bump_max_fee_pct`, default `0`.** Not a boolean, not a
rung count. At `0` the honest composer's fee ceiling is zero sats, every rung at 4×/16×/64× base
exceeds it, none is offered on that path, and the two-transaction default falls out of the value
rather than needing a second field to express it. The number is the one quantity an Operator can
actually reason about at setup: the share of the swept value the honest composer may offer as rung
fees to get it confirmed.

Precisely what it bounds on the honest composing path: **each replacement rung's ENTIRE transaction
fee.** `escape_fee_ladder` compares `base_fee * multiplier` against `total_in * pct / 100`
(`escape_fee_ladder` in `crates/vault-cli/src/fed.rs`) — so it is a cap on a rung's whole fee, not on the increment above the base. What it
does NOT bound is the base Escape itself: the base is always retained and never checked against the
ceiling, so at `0` the base still pays its own (nonzero) fee and the vault simply offers no rungs.

Setup must say that plainly, because the Ceremony cannot show the number that would make it
concrete: no Escape PSBT exists at seal time, and its fee depends on inputs, output shape and a
feerate source chosen much later. So the Ceremony states that the ceiling governs rungs only, and
the per-spend authorization UI always displays the actual base fee at spend time, because that
concrete fee cannot exist at seal time.

**3. The Ceremony must reject a value that the vault's own nodes would refuse.** The node's
fire-time guard is `fee ≤ 100 − escape_coverage_pct` (5% by default), already sealed in the
manifest. TWO hard caps exist in code, and both must be respected at seal time:
`escape_bump_max_fee_pct <= 100 - escape_coverage_pct` (the fire-time coverage guard) and
`escape_bump_max_fee_pct <= policy_core::MAX_FEE_PERCENT` (10 — the ingress cap every rung passes
through `verify_escape`). Without the second, a low coverage would admit a ceiling of 19 and a rung
over 10% would be refused at ingress, sealing a vault whose own ladder is unusable.

On top of those, **this ADR DECIDES a 5× safety margin against the coverage guard**:
`escape_bump_max_fee_pct * 5 <= 100 - escape_coverage_pct`. Stated as a decision, because it is one
— nodes accept 2–5% at the 95% default (both caps are `<=`, and policy-core's doctrine is "Exactly at the cap passes"), so this rule rejects ladders they would take. The margin
buys two things: headroom under the guard a rung is checked against at `T`, and reproduction of the
posture the tree already ships (1% under a 5% guard). It does NOT guarantee a rung always passes:
`sweep_rung_admissible` measures coverage against `protected_value` — the current authorized vault
balance — so a deposit landing during the Hold can fail even a 1% rung. This is a static bound under
full-coverage assumptions; dynamic coverage failure stays possible. It is NOT derived from
code: `fed.rs` has no computation relating its ceiling to the coverage guard —
`ESCAPE_BUMP_MAX_FEE_PCT` is a bare constant used as `total_in * pct / 100`, and the 5× ratio is an
incidental relationship between two independent constants. (`fed.rs`'s comment used to call that ratio "an order of
magnitude"; it is five times, and this change corrected the comment.) If a future reader wants
2–5%, the margin is the thing to argue with — not a node behaviour.

**3a. "Sealed" means IN THE CANONICAL PREIMAGE, not merely in `manifest.json`.** A field written to
the JSON but absent from `base_manifest_bytes` is a value the Ceremony writes and no node is bound
to. So `btc-policy-mby` must amend the preimage and the node config startup parses, in the same
change — otherwise this ADR's "sealed" is decoration.

The canonical preimage is version-bound: adding `escape_bump_max_fee_pct` changes `manifest_hash`
for otherwise-identical inputs, so it MUST ship with a protocol-version bump rather than continue
to declare `PROTOCOL_VERSION_V0`. Existing sealed vaults are unaffected — their manifests are
immutable and rotation creates a new vault.

Existing sealed vaults are unaffected in the strong sense, and the reason is ADR-0005, not care in
the rollout: a sealed node has "no reset, no reconfiguration, **no upgrade-in-place** — any change to
the federation means rotating to a new vault". So a v0 vault's nodes keep running the binary they
were sealed with and keep computing the v0 preimage; there is no path by which the extended layout
reaches them. (An earlier draft of this paragraph posed a false dilemma here — version-dispatched
hashing versus accepting that upgrading bricks a v0 vault. Both horns assume an upgrade that the
architecture forbids.) `base_manifest_bytes` computing ONE layout with `protocol_version` hashed in
rather than switched on is therefore fine, and version-dispatched hashing is NOT required.

That settles the NODE side, and the CLIENT side turns out not to need settling — for a reason that
subsumes the manifest question entirely. A v0 node binds `127.0.0.1` ONLY (`main.rs:61`) and the v0
runtime is co-located, "every node binds and is reached at `127.0.0.1:<port>`" on one hardened box
(SETUP-CEREMONY). So any client must run ON that host — and ADR-0005 seals it: no reset, no
reconfiguration, no upgrade-in-place. `btc-policy-mby` is the first sealed-vault CLI that exists, so
it is by construction absent from every host sealed before it, and cannot be installed there.

Therefore no pre-mby sealed vault is reachable by any LIVE-NODE command, whatever its manifest
format, and for those commands the compatibility question is moot rather than answered — no format
dispatch, no v0 vector, no legacy parser.

COLD RECOVERY IS THE EXCEPTION, and it is the one that matters, because it is the only exit those
vaults have. `btc-policy-en1` runs with no federation at all — "it needs only the descriptor, the
manifest, the recovery keys and a chain view" — and ROLLOUT-PLAN gates a stage on recovery being
completable "from cold artifacts alone … no live federation". Loopback binding does not obstruct it,
because it never talks to a node. But en1 is blocked on mby and shares its manifest-parsing
substrate, so if that substrate rejects pre-mby manifests then those vaults have NO exit at all,
which would make the paragraph below false. The incompatibility decision above is therefore scoped
to live-node commands only: the cold-recovery path MUST accept a pre-mby manifest, or must be able
to run from the descriptor and a chain view without one. Recorded in mby and en1.

With that, vaults sealed before mby exit through the 2-of-3 RECOVERY branch, per UTXO as each matures — NOT by rotation: UPGRADE-AND-ROTATION-POLICY.md's procedure step 3 moves the coins "as an ordinary spend through the OLD vault's normal path", and that path is precisely what no client can reach. (Two earlier drafts of this paragraph got this wrong in opposite
directions — first claiming "unaffected" without qualification, then prescribing a
`protocol_version` dispatch that cannot work because `0f16d21` changed two preimages without a
version bump. Both were reasoning about the hash while the actual barrier is the socket.)

What the version bump buys on top is a clear failure for the operator ERROR that remains possible:
pointing a new-binary node at an old manifest during a fresh deployment. Without it that misconfig
surfaces as an opaque `manifest_hash` mismatch; with it, as a version rejection.

**ADR-0013 §4's LIST MUST STAY CORRECT — but `08-wire-contract.md` IS THE AUTHORITY.**
One tie-break, stated in one place: the vector wins, because it is executable against the code and
ADR-0013 §4's prose copy has been wrong three times. ADR-0013 §4 and this ADR both defer to it. It instructs reimplementers to work "from THIS list
+ order, NOT a naive serialization". That list previously omitted `escape_feerate_floor` and
`escape_coverage_pct`, which the code hashes between `max_derivation_index` and the node count
(`channel.rs:506-509`) and which `13-operations-and-rollout.md` §Upgrade and rotation already listed as preimage
members. §4's list now includes both fields in that order, and defers to PROTOCOL-VECTORS.md as above.
`escape_bump_max_fee_pct` is an unsigned `u8`, encoded at fixed width as the single byte written by
`Enc::u8`. Its exact canonical position is immediately after `escape_coverage_pct` and immediately
before the node-count `u32`: the tail is `max_derivation_index(u32)`,
`escape_feerate_floor(u64)`, `escape_coverage_pct(u8)`, `escape_bump_max_fee_pct(u8)`, then
`nodes(u32 count, ...)`. `btc-policy-mby` must add that exact field to the canonical list when it
adds it to the preimage; otherwise this ADR's new value would be present in `manifest.json` but not
sealed by `manifest_hash`.
(Superseded in part 2026-08-21 by `btc-policy-sealed-network-v2-mn6`: at manifest schema revision 2
the sealed `network(u8)` follows `escape_bump_max_fee_pct`, so the ceiling is no longer the LAST
field before the node count. Its position relative to `escape_coverage_pct` is unchanged, the
revision-1 requirement above was met, and the tie-break stands — PROTOCOL-VECTORS.md is the tail's
authority.)

**4. The Ceremony presents the ladder and the recovery timelock as ONE question; the schema keeps
them as TWO independent fields.** The coupling is a presentation affordance, not a data model.
`recovery_timelock` and `escape_bump_max_fee_pct` are separate manifest entries, independently
validated, and the Ceremony displays the resulting value of each explicitly before sealing. An
implementation that encodes both in a single field is building the wrong thing.

The bead ordering can violate this MUST in an intermediate release, and the result is irreversible.
`btc-policy-mby` adds the ladder's Ceremony input; `btc-policy-wdu` is what later makes the recovery
timelock a choice and merges the two prompts. Between them the Ceremony would put the ladder
question alone in front of an operator, and vaults sealed in that window are sealed forever. Resolve
it the cheap way rather than by coupling the beads: `mby`'s prompt must show the recovery timelock
alongside the ladder ceiling as a FIXED, displayed value (which is what it is today — 180 days, no
setting), so the operator still reasons about both together and only the second value is
selectable. `wdu` then turns that displayed constant into the second half of the question.

The same ordering trap applies to the ceiling's own value, and it is worse because it is silent.
`btc-policy-mby` exposes this Ceremony input but submits `escape_bumps = []`; `btc-policy-sqn`
is what composes the rungs a nonzero ceiling admits. A vault sealed with a nonzero ceiling in
between therefore behaves as ladderless FOREVER — sealed loopback-only hosts take no upgrade —
while its operator believes they opted in and priced that into their duress plan. So mby must
REJECT a nonzero `escape_bump_max_fee_pct` until sqn ships, offering only the default 0, or the
two must land together. Accepting a value the vault can never honour is the failure to avoid here, just as landing the
ladder input while the timelock is invisible is the failure to avoid above: both seal a choice
the operator did not actually get to make. Note the remedies are opposite — display the
constant there, reject the value here — so do not let a later edit collapse them into one rule.

Both fields, and their descriptor / manifest / preimage representations, must be committed under ONE finalize boundary. They are independently represented but jointly chosen, so a ceremony interrupted mid-write must leave nothing sealed and be safely retriable — never half the joint choice, which no later edit can repair because the manifest is immutable.

**4a. The SIGNER checks the ladder against the sealed ceiling as composition validation, not as
hostile-coordinator enforcement.** "SIGNER" here means the component behind `btc-policy-mby`'s signing seam — a software key on signet, hardware later via `btc-policy-bq6` — not a node and not the composing CLI. Nodes do NOT enforce `escape_bump_max_fee_pct` at all — that single omission is what this paragraph is about, and it is not a claim that nodes skip other rung validation: every rung still passes `verify_escape`, `policy_core::MAX_FEE_PERCENT` and the fire-time coverage guard, and at the wrench
the Coordinator composes the authorization object the Operator is asked to sign. The signer
therefore compares each supplied ladder with the ceiling from its own authenticated manifest and
refuses a directly presented over-ceiling ladder. That catches an honest-path composition mistake
and a naive hostile ladder, preserving the two-transaction default and keeping fee-policy choices
out of the Operator's hands on the honest duress path.

**Decided 2026-10-04: nodes do not recompute the honest composer's ladder.** `CHN-17` remains
"The honest composer's ladder", and `MAN-13` retains "nodes never enforce it". This preserves
ADR-0012's boundary: "Nodes validate the escape; they do NOT build it". `SPN-27` says "An Escape
whose evaluation refuses stages nothing": a gate-25 disagreement between a node's independent
derivation and the composer's could therefore leave an honest duress request unarmed. The
sequence decision below bounds stripping at the admissible base without adding that refusal.
The per-node ladder split is accepted, with its delivery and admissibility limits stated below.

That check is NOT an integrity guarantee against a hostile Coordinator. It cannot detect a validly
signed over-ceiling PSBT obtained earlier as the ceiling-exempt base Escape, as an escape-class
spend, or in another authorization request and then replayed later as a bump. SIGHASH_ALL
authenticates the transaction bytes, not the base/rung role or authorization group; neither sealed
state nor the signature carries that missing context. The sealed ceiling is therefore a
deterministic per-vault COMPOSITION DISCIPLINE for the honest path, not the adversarial fee-loss
bound. The bounds that still apply to a hostile Coordinator are node-side: every rung passes the
`policy_core::MAX_FEE_PERCENT` (10) ingress cap, and the fire-time coverage guard limits fee loss to
`100 - escape_coverage_pct` of protected value.

Caller-supplied labels remain display aids, and the signer's authority comes from sealed state it
loaded itself — but that state cannot always authenticate a ROLE. For an escape-class
`SpendRequest`, both the immediate spend and its mandatory distinct, disjoint residual pay the
sealed escape descriptor, so the signer cannot derive which is "spend" and which is "residual" from
destinations or wallet membership. It MUST approve every otherwise-valid pair and display both as
generic escape-destination transactions, making no positional role claim. It MUST NOT reject on the
ground that the roles are indistinguishable: sealed state cannot distinguish the roles of ANY valid
pair, so that branch rejects every escape-class spend and disables the escape-class
path entirely — including the FREE-TO-ACT clawback in OPERATIONS-RUNBOOK's "An unauthorized spend
is pending", which is the honest-coordinator case and the one that must keep working. (Do NOT cite
the duress case here: after a wrench the same runbook forbids the normal-PIN clawback, because the
relay is hostile and would learn the normal PIN. The escape-class SHAPE must stay admissible; the
duress-time USE of it does not.) Unauthenticated role is a display limit, not
an admissibility defect.

**5. Nothing pin-dependent crosses the signing seam.** The seam takes no PIN parameter, so no signer
implementation can vary its behaviour by pin class — it never receives the input that would let it.
(The normal/duress VERDICT is computed node-side and never exists client-side at all.) The number
of transactions presented follows transaction class and sealed ladder policy — never the pin — which
is what keeps ladder length from becoming a count/presentation observable.

## Consequences

**This is permanent per vault — but state exactly what is permanent.** ADR-0005 seals the host; the
manifest cannot change afterwards. A vault sealed while `escape_bump_max_fee_pct` does not exist
permanently lacks a SEALED, DETERMINISTIC CEILING. It is NOT protocol-barred from ever carrying a
ladder: nodes never consult the field, the `/sign` handler's length cap accepts up to
`MAX_ESCAPE_BUMPS` rungs from any vault, and no sealed LADDER-POLICY field (presence, length,
ceiling) constrains composition — `fed.rs` does read one sealed value, the descriptor's satisfaction
weight, but only to size the relay-increment filter — so an Operator with
a tool that offers rungs can still sign them and have them accepted. What such a vault lacks is the
per-vault discipline this ADR is about, not the capability. The field still lands with the Ceremony
in `btc-policy-mby` for that reason, which is a weaker one than "no path to a ladder" — and the
weaker reason is the true one.

**A default vault's Escape may fail to confirm.** With no ladder, an admissible sweep fires at its
base fee only. Under congestion it may not make it, and the funds then exit via the Recovery path. This does
not break a stated invariant — ADR-0012's "Lockdown at T is unconditional" bullet is explicit that
*"Safety = freeze + lockdown → recovery, independent of the sweep"* — but it converts a fast exit into a slow one, and the Operator chose
that at setup rather than discovering it at `T`.

**Sealing binds the CEREMONY and the composing tool — NOT a hostile relay.** Nodes DO check every
submitted rung's content against node policy — `verify_escape` runs per bump at ingress, and
fire-time selection is clamped by the sealed coverage guard — but neither check enforces the sealed
ladder ceiling. What no node checks is the ladder's PRESENCE OR LENGTH against any sealed ladder
policy. An empty ladder is allowed, but its base still faces `SPN-27`'s sequence check "even when
the ladder is empty". A post-wrench coordinator holds the auth key, so it can drop rungs and re-sign the shortened request, and the
vault's sealed ceiling will not stop it. State the limit plainly rather than implying otherwise:
what this decision buys is that the OPERATOR is not asked to make a fee-policy choice under duress,
and that the honest composing path is deterministic per vault. It is NOT an integrity guarantee
about what reaches a node.

**Every Escape signals, decided 2026-10-04.** `CHN-15` requires "every input's `nSequence` to
`0xfffffffd`, on the base and on every rung, with or without a fee ladder". The non-signalling
Escape form is withdrawn. Signalling permits replacement and prevents neither relay nor
confirmation; under full-RBF, a non-signalling mark buys no protection against replacement
anyway. There is no conditional base rewrite when the composer adds or removes a ladder.
Ingress owns this check: `SPN-27` says "any other sequence value refuses as `escape:bump_ladder`".
The fire-time fee predicate stays in `DUR-23`: "`fee = total_in − Σ outputs`; `vsize` MUST be
positive" and "`fee ≥ escape_feerate_floor × vsize` compared in arithmetic that cannot overflow".
The withdrawn reference behavior is recorded, unverified here, in `DEF-22`; its recorded test is
`a_ladderless_escape_still_requires_a_non_signalling_sequence`.

Stripping is bounded at the admissible base, whether the coordinator shortens every delivery
alike or differently per node. The possible fee outcomes follow the selection rule `DUR-26`:
"target   = bump target (DUR-30), or 0 on any error or no reading" and "if the ladder has one
rung:   rung 0 if admissible, else fail".

- Strip every rung and the base sweeps at its own fee when admissible, subject to enough
  successful fire passes and partial delivery in the fire window. It may fail to confirm.
- Strip the rung that would have met the target while leaving a more expensive admissible one,
  and the node can fire that instead: bounded overpayment.
- Strip every target-reaching rung but leave a below-target one, and the sweep can fire below
  the bump target, fail to confirm and leave the funds to Recovery.

A per-node split can make the base the only finalizable variant even when every node has a higher
rung. `SPN-32` retains "the same **ordered rung txids**, including the empty list" on a compatible
repeat; `NCH-24` requires that "the rung is found by txid" and "the user-signature hash matches".
The first accepted ladder is local, and refusing another ladder does not merge it. `CNF-149` owns
the executable implementation scenario: its distinct higher rungs are each held below quorum,
while the common base pools partials. `DUR-28` qualifies the agreement: "That agreement covers the
base transaction, not the ladder". This accepts loss of fee acceleration, not unconditional base
admissibility, confirmation or progress under arbitrary delivery failure. Re-signing the same base
with different user-signature bytes needs the user's key and is outside this coordinator-only
stripping power. Commitment identity and registration remain unchanged.

The signer has an adjacent ROLE-REPLAY residual: a hostile Coordinator can first present an
over-ceiling transaction as the ceiling-exempt base Escape, as an escape-class spend, or in another
authorization request, then reuse those exact signed bytes as a bump. The signer check catches the
direct over-ceiling presentation, not this reuse, because the signature binds bytes rather than the
role in which those bytes were authorized. The result can exceed the sealed ceiling, including for
a vault sealed at 0.

The stripping outcomes and this role-replay residual are bounded, and none is theft: every rung
is user-signed SIGHASH_ALL over its own bytes, every destination output pays the user's escape
descriptor and every remaining output is verified vault change, the 10%
`policy_core::MAX_FEE_PERCENT` cap runs at ingress, and the fire-time coverage guard caps the
fee against protected value. Replay can therefore cause bounded OVERPAYMENT to the user's own
escape wallet, never redirection and never an unsigned transaction — the same shape as the separate
escape-class role-order residual below. Those node-side guards, not the sealed ceiling, are the real
hostile-coordinator fee-loss bound. Node-side enforcement of the sealed ceiling is therefore NOT
specified here; if it is ever wanted it is a protocol change with its own bead.

**A separate escape-class role-order residual is accepted.** The immediate spend and mandatory
residual are distinct, disjoint PSBTs that both pay the user's sealed escape descriptor. Their
SIGHASH_ALL signatures bind each transaction's bytes, not its request role, while the coordinator's
`canonical_bytes` binds those PSBTs only positionally (`spend_psbt` then `escape_psbt`). A
post-wrench coordinator holding the auth key can therefore swap the two positions, issue a fresh
`coord_sig`, and still present a node-valid escape-class request. The effect includes WHICH disjoint
coin set moves immediately versus at `T`, and can also suppress the residual sweep entirely: the
spend role releases immediately without `sweep_rung_admissible`, while only the residual faces the
fire-time feerate-floor and coverage checks. For example, swapping a relay-valid 1
sat/vB spend with a 20 sat/vB residual under a 20 sat/vB floor broadcasts the latter immediately
but rejects the former at `T`. The remaining funds stay frozen and exit through Recovery. Both
destinations nevertheless remain the user's escape wallet, neither transaction's user-signed bytes
can be changed, and the coordinator still cannot redirect funds or introduce a transaction the user
did not sign. This residual is why the signer display must not claim a spend/residual distinction it
cannot authenticate.

**The timelock is coupled to the ladder in BOTH directions, and to refresh as well.** This is the
part that is invisible until stated:

- The timelock sets how long the funds are immobile if the sweep misses. A longer timelock makes the
  ladder worth more.
- The timelock is also **the refresh deadline**. Per `btc-policy-ye8`, once the recovery branch
  matures the 2-of-3 recovery keyset — *distributed to third parties by design, since it doubles as
  the inheritance mechanism* — becomes a complete authorization path needing no PIN, no user key, no
  Hold, no allowlist and no federation. A shorter timelock therefore obliges more frequent refreshes.

So the Ceremony's single question is genuinely three-way: immobility risk, ladder value, and refresh
cadence all move together. Presenting the timelock and the ladder independently invites the one
combination that maximises immobility — a long timelock with no ladder — chosen by an Operator with
no basis to see the interaction.

## Alternatives rejected

**A separate on/off flag beside a ceiling.** Two fields that can disagree — a flag saying "on" with
a ceiling of zero has no meaning, and validating the pair is work that a single number does not
need. Rejected as redundant.

**Choosing the ladder per spend.** Rejected because the moment the sweep matters most is the moment
the Operator is least able to reason about fee policy. NOT rejected on integrity grounds — see the
consequence above: a hostile relay can already vary the submitted ladder, sealed or not, so "the
coordinator cannot change it per request" is not a property this decision delivers.

**Rung count, or the multipliers, as the sealed knob.** Both are implementation facts. An Operator
cannot answer "how many rungs?" but can answer "what share of my money will I pay to get it out?" —
and with a ceiling the rung count already falls out of it, since rungs exceeding the ceiling are
simply not offered.

**Deferring the field until the derivation is built.** Rejected, but on narrower grounds than an
earlier draft of this ADR claimed. Vaults sealed in the interval are NOT protocol-barred from a
ladder (see the permanence consequence above); what they permanently lack is a sealed deterministic
ceiling, so their ladders are whatever tool composes them rather than a per-vault property. The
field is cheap and that asymmetry is irreversible, which is enough — "permanently ladder-less" was
not true and is not the reason.
